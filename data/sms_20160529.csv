2015-10-26,11:32:39,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Did you finish the changes we talked about? 
2015-10-26,11:32:56,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Also aren't you job hunting today? 
2015-10-26,11:33:42,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,I was going to job hunt but my sister got sick today and my mom and dad are at work

2015-10-26,11:48:17,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr., Gotcha. And yeah do it to all of them. And make transparent background
2015-10-26,11:49:00,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Didn't we already do the transparent background though or was that just for the heading?
2015-10-26,12:27:46,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,You probably should do it for all of it?

2015-10-26,13:43:11,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Yeah but we're using CSS for the tables unless maybe I missed something in the formula I'll double check on that :-)
2015-10-26,13:54:29,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Hmm not sure I understand what you're asking then. Just keep playing with it
2015-10-26,13:55:20,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,What I was saying is maybe I forgot something that was supposed to make it react like how I wanted it to be according to the code maybe I miss something it's just a theory but anywho I will tinker with it and see what I can do to fix it

2015-10-27,08:07:38,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Hey Joe I'm pretty close to fixing this problem I've been going at it one question remember how we had a so-called subject CSS tag that affects all properties well couldn't we make another tag like that but I can use it only for my text headings? I'm starting to see a pattern here and I was wondering if there was possible have to of those kinds of tags
2015-10-27,09:31:15,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,"Definitely! You can have as many classes as you want. When you're wondering something like this, just try it :)"
2015-10-27,09:32:45,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Well I got one transparent background behind one of my headings for a subject I put it as a heading but then when I put the next one down you didn't work like the last one but the text is still showing where the subject is the subject referring to is Link and the one that I got done was Mario
2015-10-27,10:06:34,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,"Try to figure out why that's happening instead of what you expect. This is called troubleshooting, and it's the hardest and most important part of programming."
2015-10-27,10:08:37,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,I actually just figured it out about a few minutes ago I ended up having to put another class tag and I put the title of the subject under each class and it worked when you get a chance see for yourself and tell me how it looks :-)@
2015-10-27,10:09:04,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,I will! You job hunting today?
2015-10-27,10:09:48,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Perhaps

2015-11-02,21:10:58,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Find a website that does that as an example
2015-11-02,21:11:50,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,That's my first day of work. Also a high school friend is already crashing with me that night lol. Literally any other day?

2015-11-03,08:32:36,out,+14406232199,Amar Shah,Lol I know. I turned it on at the beginning of the fourth quarter and it was 94-49
2015-11-03,09:40:59,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Let me guess no website does that? I mean I guess I was just thinking outside the box there for a minute
2015-11-03,09:59:18,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,"Since you're still learning, try to emulate good websites. There are good ways and bad ways to make websites. And I'm not talking about code; I'm talking about design. Often, it's good to do it one way and bad to do it another. For instance, here's an article about a few principles: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/10-principles-of-effective-web-design/"
2015-11-03,10:00:18,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,"The hardest part about web design isn't the code; it's the design and making it look good and having people like it. No one ever goes to a website and says, ""Woah, I love the CSS here."" They say, ""Woah, this is a clean and really usable website."" "
2015-11-03,10:01:18,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,But don't you want a website that sometimes jumps out at you and grabs your attention? It's not about the effects it's about trying to spice it up a little bit with the effects
2015-11-03,10:01:47,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,I disagree
2015-11-03,10:02:16,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,"You don't want it to be boring, but if you look at great websites, they don't over-stimulate or distract; they make you focus on the most important part of the page, then get out of the way"
2015-11-03,10:02:21,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Well you do got a point I guess it's a matter of getting straight to the point with the website rather than trying to show off right?
2015-11-03,10:02:47,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,It's like your wardrobe; you want to look good without being flashy
2015-11-03,10:04:57,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,I see what you mean its like designing a poster you want people to get the message or reason why you made the poster instead of putting every possible decoration on it to distract the message right
2015-11-03,10:09:04,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,"Yep, and best way to get good at that is to look at good websites."

2015-11-07,21:37:07,in,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,For sure. Every time I hear a new story about the drunken revelry everyone is getting into I feel a little nostalgic

2015-11-07,21:47:20,in,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,Oh I feel that. This is such a transient period in everyone's lives too- just constant uprooting and relocating. I'm trying to look at it positively- it's probably the only time we'll ever get to travel and try so many new things
2015-11-08,00:39:14,out,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,"Yeah, it can be a burden or a blessing. I think when I'm older, I'll look back fondly (or enviously) on that time when I could go anywhere and do anything and meet anyone. The chore of making new friends every year or two will sound like an adventure. Basically, I need mid-life-crisis-Joe to remind me that these are the glory days haha"
2015-11-08,01:54:08,in,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,"Truth haha. Present day self has gotta take one for the team for my 20-years-from-now self.  For me, it's always tough to appreciate where I am in the present. And I always look back and say ""damnit that wasn't so bad"""

2015-11-18,17:29:20,out,+16506468779,Mike Weingert,"Hard to say. Orientation has been expectedly painful. The project and team seem pretty cool, but don't have a taste for my day to day yet."

2015-11-18,18:21:43,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Hey Joe quick question should a javascript stylesheet be separate from the HTML sheet or can I put the JavaScript codes on the HTML sheet? I'm just asking this in case you're going to look at my quiz page update that I put on my kingdom hearts folder in Dropbox
2015-11-18,18:56:38,out,+16506468779,Mike Weingert,"Ended today, though I have to do a fuckton of online training now. I think I'll like it once I understand what's happening. Haven't figured out all the jargon yet"
2015-11-18,18:58:25,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,"There JavaScript can be in the html inside the <script> tags, or in another file (use the .js extension) and include it in your junk file. It's like CSS; you can either embed it out break out out and include it"
2015-11-18,19:15:12,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Okay cuz I used it in my quiz sheet for the website on the HTML sheet I am kind of wondering how JavaScrip sheets work I've only worked them once but I think I need a thorough tutorial on how to do that which I will look up anyway if you saw the quiz sheet how do you like it
2015-11-18,19:35:00,in,+16506468779,Mike Weingert,Yeah. How ... Bureaucratic ... Does it seem so far?
2015-11-18,19:35:13,in,+14406232199,Amar Shah,What're you up to tomorrow afternoon? One of the guys I met while at Cleveland clinic for a month actually lives in royal oak and is interviewing with me 
2015-11-18,19:35:17,in,+14406232199,Amar Shah,"tomorrow. We were gonna go grab a beer after the interview is over and since he knows royal oak well, figure you'd be interested "
2015-11-18,20:59:58,out,+14406232199,Amar Shah,Oh yeah! What time?
2015-11-18,21:00:44,out,+16506468779,Mike Weingert,Incredibly. I probably won't have a computer with network access for another few days. Some people have had to wait weeks or months to get set up
2015-11-18,21:03:00,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Haven't yet. Is that from a tutorial?
2015-11-18,21:05:16,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,It's basic as far as format goes if that's  what you mean so I don't think I stole it from a tutorial all I used was just buttons and alert boxes for the page but it was hard getting everything lined up as far as images 
2015-11-18,21:16:36,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Was the JavaScript from a tutorial?
2015-11-18,21:18:16,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,How to make the button and alert box  those were tutorials I knew how to do them before it's just my memory was a little foggy
2015-11-18,21:57:18,in,+16506468779,Mike Weingert,If you don't get network access for months that's like 1/6th of your contract

2015-11-18,23:54:04,out,+16506468779,Mike Weingert,"Also, got your quarter-long trip planned out? Namely, have you decided when you're going to whip your dick out?"
2015-11-18,23:57:18,in,+16506468779,Mike Weingert,Data visualization and I can take art courses which could be fun.
2015-11-18,23:57:34,in,+16506468779,Mike Weingert,"Hahaha and the answer to the second question is always. I'm going to Japan and Korea for January with some friends I interned with at Google, and then I'm planning to live in Russia for a month (assuming I get a visa) and then pop by Ukraine on my way back to California"

2015-12-02,22:32:44,in,+16506567075,Mico Diaz,College is way too volatile. Single elimination and crazy turnover every year

2015-12-02,22:36:27,in,+16506567075,Mico Diaz,There are stats for that now. They even release stuff like opposing fg% of the players man and shooting % within 5 feet of the shot blocker

2015-12-02,22:40:47,in,+16506567075,Mico Diaz,"Hmm good point. Isnt the game to game volatility also kind of crazy, when each player gets 4 at bats per game with a wide array of potential returns per at bat?"
2015-12-02,22:42:05,out,6506567075,Mico Diaz,"Yeah, but there are 30-40 at bats per team per game. Probably end up using the same principles as in Moneyball, or something like it."

But it's a wash because that just means that the vegas odds are proportionally more likely to be right. All that really matters is that we find an edge, and that's most likely in whichever sport we know best. Probably basketball?"

Once we get something up and running, we can plug in tons of variables and tons of outcomes, and see what we can predict the best."

2016-01-02,00:31:18,out,+12164825854,Lukun Zhang,I've actually never been in a food fight. But I think it'd be awesome to open a place where kids could come have food fights. Would make a killing off of birthdays and class trips

2016-01-04,09:44:48,in,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,"Mmm. Yeah from what I've heard, sounds government/ army work is kind of a mixed bag of bureaucratic bullshit and somewhat interesting work. Hope the taste you're acquiring gets better rather than worse "
2016-01-04,09:45:15,in,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,And oh my God it's SO hard to make friends in the real world. I'm sure it's like 20 times harder in a place like Detroit too
2016-01-04,10:01:35,out,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,"Haha I'm sure it will, most things improve with time (at least initially). And yeah...Detroit is legit probably the biggest city in the US where I didn't know a single person before coming here haha"
2016-01-04,10:02:15,out,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,But it's a good exercise I suppose. Makes you get waaaay out of your comfort zone
2016-01-04,10:08:21,out,+12485041397,Rachel Zuckerman,Did you guys take any of my recommendations in LA?

2016-01-04,11:49:17,in,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,"It's so true. I know that whenever I move somewhere new, I always HATE it for a while until I get used to it. Granted, I'm not sure how much there is to love about Detroit haha. But like you said, good learning experience. If you can survive in Detroit, you can make it anywhere"
2016-01-04,11:49:28,in,+14407965927,Mom,Yes.  Do the Huhs need a room?  Friday- Mon?
2016-01-04,11:51:45,out,+14407965927,Mom,"They said they wanted to come, though I couldn't tell if they were absolutely in. I was going to call them today anyways to wish them a happy anniversary. I can let you know then?"
2016-01-04,12:04:35,in,+14407965927,Mom,Sounds good. Tell them I said happy anniversary too!

2016-01-04,15:37:54,out,+14407965927,Mom,Tried calling them at  3525277426. Is that the number you have for them?
2016-01-04,16:04:46,out,+12485041397,Rachel Zuckerman,Not a bad alternative. I still want my commission though. 
2016-01-04,16:07:07,out,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,"Haha fair enough. And if I don't survive Detroit, I can still probably make it most places"
2016-01-04,16:31:48,in,+12485041397,Rachel Zuckerman,And what do you consider adequate commission? 
2016-01-04,17:11:38,in,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,Lol well as long as you don't get shot we'll call it a win
2016-01-04,17:47:54,out,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,Just nothing fatal or crippling. Let's not set the bar too high

2016-01-04,17:59:44,out,+14407965927,Mom,"Hm, OK. I'll try again tonight. Maybe we could pay the extra fee to make it refundable? Or do you think we should hold off?"
2016-01-04,18:00:55,in,+14407965927,Mom,"Try one more time tonight.  Or, try texting them."
2016-01-04,18:47:16,out,+12485041397,Rachel Zuckerman,That's for you to decide ;)
2016-01-04,18:47:38,out,+12485041397,Rachel Zuckerman,Although something along the lines of a beer would probably do the trick 
2016-01-04,18:47:55,out,+14407965927,Mom,Will do 
2016-01-04,19:01:55,in,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,Haha true. Just enough to give you some street cred 
2016-01-04,19:13:18,in,+12485041397,Rachel Zuckerman,Haha ok I'll think about what I owe you. I want you to teach me about beer cause you sound like quite the connoisseur and I know literally nothing.

2016-01-04,19:30:25,out,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,"Yeah, I wonder if there's someone I could pay to carefully give me a non-fatal gsw. Just like in the left shoulder or something--hopefully that won't hurt my basketball game."
2016-01-04,19:31:31,in,+12485041397,Rachel Zuckerman,"I'm positive you know more than I do. For example, what is Natty Light and Keystone?"

I think I have a pretty good bead on the situation, though I'm still trying to make sense of how I feel about it. But if you think there's something I should hear, I'm free Wednesday evening :)"

I've just been rather conservative with alcohol consumption in the past for no specific reason. But I turned 21 earlier this month so I've had a few drinks recently, but still no beer "
2016-01-04,21:37:07,in,+12484819133,Breah,Actually I'm just trying to figure out a way to cram one last minute class into my schedule. I would be down to hang out later.

But yeah...you've got some major catching up to do. First tip--don't drink Natty Light or Keystone unless you're already too drunk to taste anything. And at that point, you should actually probably just stop drinking."

2016-01-07,09:13:20,in,+14124917035,Andrew Brown,My thought is yes. Endymion is the Saturday before and is also just as fun. In general though Mardi Gras is kind of a crappy time to see NOLA because it's challenging to get from one part of the city to the other (parades close all sorts of streets)

2016-01-08,22:37:53,out,+12533890402,Alex,"Maybe. To be fair, you told me to have a good day at work Tuesday night, and Wednesday was literally my first fun day of work since I started. So maybe you might be right..."

2016-01-09,01:51:59,out,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,"Yeah, but that's just one person. Everyone is looking for something different, so don't think that means any other guy would feel the same."

2016-01-09,10:19:40,in,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,Also I have a sneaking suspicion that this is part of a ploy to convert me to a cavs fan haha
2016-01-09,10:24:01,out,+17815721108,Steph Dalwin,Ah you're onto me! But it's too late. Kyrie's handles are just too smooth.

2016-01-09,10:54:52,in,+17862660024,Carly Morales,When were u thinking?
2016-01-09,11:16:48,out,+12533890402,Alex,Oh yeah! I think I may have stopped there on a pub crawl or something. Was it a good time at night?

2016-01-09,13:55:55,out,+12533890402,Alex,"How late were you out? Now that I'm used to being an adult who goes to bed early, I won't make it past 1am unless I'm realllly drunk haha"
2016-01-09,14:14:38,in,+12533890402,Alex,Haha I'm the same way! It's so hard to even make it to midnight nowadays! I was out until about 2....and I was realllly drunk...haha

2016-01-09,15:50:05,out,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,That was really cool. I really did think someone was coming in my door haha
2016-01-09,16:22:30,in,+12533890402,Alex,Haha I don't know if I could be a productive human if that was my Friday night every Friday...where did you end up going last night? 
2016-01-09,16:57:44,in,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,It's petty cool that they figured out how sounds coming from different positions are filtered before reaching your eardrum.

2016-01-09,17:37:52,out,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,"It was shocking how effective it was. I think there could be some serious potential for our ""sports watching"" app. Or in general, a speaker call mode where you can set the ""position"" of each person"
2016-01-09,17:38:32,out,+12533890402,Alex,You have 2 days to recover :) Might want to take it a bit easier tonight lol
2016-01-09,17:39:02,out,+12533890402,Alex,Started at BW3 for food and the game. Ended up at Bastone.
2016-01-09,17:51:04,in,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,That would make make the sports watching much more immersive. One thing that could be diffcult is changing the audio based as the person turns there head.
2016-01-09,17:51:56,in,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,I wonder if that technolgy exists yet.

2016-01-09,18:12:51,in,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,"(1/2) True. In terms of the sporting application, the audio stream sent from the arena would need to be filtered in realtime on the users hardware based on the "
2016-01-09,18:12:56,in,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,(2/2) users head direction (maybe we could access head tracking from whatever VR helmet is used)
2016-01-09,19:00:23,out,+12533890402,Alex,"Honestly, I think teaching kindergarten takes more energy than going out all night. Do Brain Breaks work for clubbing? BW3 is good for watching sports, but not much else. Bastone has really good beer though :)"

2016-01-09,19:22:39,in,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,Which one? The app?
2016-01-09,19:24:12,in,+12533890402,Alex,It can! But I don't ever feel hungover after teaching my kids haha I haven't tried my brain breaks at a club yet but I imagine they are pretty transferable! Ooo I might have to go and check out Bastone if you say it's good! 
2016-01-09,19:52:26,out,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,Yeah. Just something where I can take a stereo stream and make it feel like it's at a specific spot relative to me

2016-01-09,23:38:28,in,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,The one thing about this is that I don't think this is very mainstream. Maybe it's something that could become trendy if it feels really natural.

2016-01-16,19:51:50,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Congrats. You guys are too good and too lucky
2016-01-16,19:52:11,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Okay, I've gotten like three texts about how lucky we are"
2016-01-16,19:52:56,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Think maybe that means you guys are really lucky?
2016-01-16,19:52:57,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Yes that play was lucky but they would've gotten the ball at like the 5 with 20 seconds left
2016-01-16,19:53:10,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,It's not as if it would change the outcome of the game
2016-01-16,19:53:31,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Agreed. Which made it even more ridiculous.
2016-01-16,19:53:54,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"I would consider the helmet catch, manningham catch and Kearse catch far more ""lucky"""
2016-01-16,19:54:10,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,And they all drastically changed the game
2016-01-16,19:55:02,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Idk, I honestly think people are looking for reasons to hate at that point. The game was extremely clean"
2016-01-16,19:55:07,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Almost no flags
2016-01-16,19:56:13,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Haha I don't think anyone claims you won the game on luck. It's just uncanny how consistently things go the patriots way, even when they don't matter"
2016-01-16,19:57:35,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Like when?
2016-01-16,19:59:55,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Like the interception on 4th down got waived off. And that deflected ball went right to your guy when it could have just as readily been picked.
2016-01-16,20:01:46,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"I mean, the play was reviewed and overturned... Wouldn't call that lucky. Plenty people been fucked by the catch rule lately. The last play was lucky, but I don't think things consistently fall our way. Smith had the fourth and long where he avoided three sacks and tossed it to continue it"
2016-01-16,20:03:35,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Haha OK man, you can have this one. Wasn't trying to question the Patriot's aura "
2016-01-16,20:04:36,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Hahaha
2016-01-16,20:05:16,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Sorry, I just get peeved when people reach out to me to say that they won the game because of favoritism"
2016-01-16,20:08:23,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"It's a big part of my families life, understand its sports but I get defensive. I wouldn't say we never get breaks but I think it's about even - lost two sb and almost a third on luck plays and nfl has stripped high draft picks on a disproved allegation"
2016-01-16,20:08:47,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"You going out tonight? Matt Lawrence, Russom jstarr and I are gonna head out"
2016-01-16,23:02:06,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Yep, talked to my ex from Stanford for an hour (great story there for next time I see you), but am out now. Also, cardinals are luckier than patriots"
2016-01-16,23:02:14,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Tell frat I said hey

2016-01-17,02:32:37,in,+19064402540,Taryn MacInnis,For qdoba and back at the guys' house watching cardinals recap lolol
2016-01-17,02:41:48,out,+19064402540,Taryn MacInnis,Qdoba is still open??
2016-01-17,02:42:07,out,+19064402540,Taryn MacInnis,"Also, that game was nuts. You really are a guy."
2016-01-17,02:44:00,in,+19064402540,Taryn MacInnis, Yes. Lol... Surprise!
2016-01-17,02:46:33,out,+19064402540,Taryn MacInnis,This is probably the best way to find out haha
2016-01-17,02:52:09,out,+19064402540,Taryn MacInnis,Some surprises are better than others...
2016-01-17,11:21:03,out,+18083660804,Yuki Bailey,Hey sorry for cutting off our convo yesterday. I'm free this afternoon if you want to finish it up
2016-01-17,11:30:14,out,+13132444230,Tori Jovanovski,Hey great meeting you yesterday! I'm glad we chose the less kooky coffee shop haha
2016-01-17,11:49:02,in,+13132444230,Tori Jovanovski,Nice to meet you too! Yeah the other place is kind of a lot. If you venture in you'll have to tell me what you think haha
2016-01-17,12:25:04,out,+13132444230,Tori Jovanovski,Sounds like I might need to be under the influence of something to get myself in there haha
2016-01-17,12:52:41,in,+13132444230,Tori Jovanovski,Yes or perhaps best avoided haha
2016-01-17,13:35:08,out,+13132444230,Tori Jovanovski,You didn't give me too many alternatives for things to do though...
2016-01-17,13:48:38,out,+12533890402,Alex,"If you're feeling better, don't turn on the Seahawks game right now."
2016-01-17,13:50:43,in,+12533890402,Alex,Too late üòñ and just when I was starting to feel a little better....
2016-01-17,13:58:02,out,+12533890402,Alex,This is hard to watch. Going to be a long day for your boys.
2016-01-17,14:02:22,in,+18083660804,Yuki Bailey,"It's ok, I was running late myself. I won't be free until like 1-ish my time though"
2016-01-17,14:04:40,in,+12533890402,Alex,I think I'm going to throw up again just watching this game...so disappointing! 
2016-01-17,14:05:49,out,+18083660804,Yuki Bailey,"I have something at 6 my time, so any time before that is fine."
2016-01-17,14:12:15,out,+12533890402,Alex,I can't even think of an analogy for a game this bad. It's like watching...Babe Ruth vs a pinata?
2016-01-17,14:13:44,in,+18083660804,Yuki Bailey,Alright cool
2016-01-17,14:19:37,in,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,Just ran into Lawrence on the streets of Miami haha
2016-01-17,14:22:01,in,+12533890402,Alex,Ha! Even that is better than this game...at least it ends with candy 
2016-01-17,14:25:23,out,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,"Oh yeah, saw he was there! There are like 10 people I know in Miami right now..."
2016-01-17,14:25:46,out,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,"Also, was that club actually Cleveland-themed?"
2016-01-17,14:25:55,in,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,It's the place to be apparently ha
2016-01-17,14:26:01,out,+12533890402,Alex,Not if you're the pinata..
2016-01-17,14:26:08,in,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,Ha we popped in and popped out so I'm not sure
2016-01-17,14:27:08,out,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,Seems to be haha. Karl was trying to get me to come to Miami next week
2016-01-17,14:32:33,in,+12533890402,Alex,This is true...and we are most definitely the piqata. That was the worst first half I have ever watched in my life....
2016-01-17,14:32:51,in,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,Do it! It's so nice. Weather's perfect
2016-01-17,14:48:59,out,+12533890402,Alex,"I mean, as a Browns fan, that was pretty familiar. But this isn't supposed to happen in the playoffs..."
2016-01-17,14:49:52,out,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,It's a lot of money to come see Karl and Nico when I could just drive to Chicago to see Karl (and not Nico). 
2016-01-17,14:50:10,out,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,But thanks for making me even more depressed about Detroit weather -_-
2016-01-17,14:51:08,in,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,"Haha yeah if it's Nico too maybe not, maybe come another weekend sans Nico haha"
2016-01-17,15:05:51,in,+12533890402,Alex,Ugh how could you watch this week after week!? At least they are getting some pep in their step now! 
2016-01-17,15:07:56,out,+18025987688,Charlotte Salsgiver,My thoughts exactly haha
2016-01-17,15:19:55,out,+12533890402,Alex,Don't jinx it!
2016-01-17,15:49:43,in,+12533890402,Alex,I know I need to shut my mouth! I can't jinx anything right now....
2016-01-17,16:02:21,out,+12533890402,Alex,I'll jinx it for you: this is insane!!

2016-01-17,16:37:25,in,+12533890402,Alex,Haha that's good to hear! Now I can sleep a little better tonight 
2016-01-17,20:25:06,in,+13132444230,Tori Jovanovski,"Haha true, sorry. Guess it's not that interesting here--but better than Montana?"
2016-01-17,20:39:46,out,+12533890402,Alex,At least you have the day off tomorrow to properly mourn the loss!
2016-01-17,21:00:20,in,+12533890402,Alex,Haha yes it is much needed! Especially since I'm still not feeling 100%...
2016-01-17,21:05:28,out,+19064402540,Taryn MacInnis,Great meeting you last night! Thanks for the free ballroom dance lesson haha

2016-01-17,21:49:38,out,+19414055914,Austin Childs,"Haha I guess this is the modern form of being a player. One got sick, one went radio silent, but I met the third one who was pretty cool/cute/smart. And got a girl's number at a club last night (we call that ""the old fashioned way""). So overall a decent weekend I guess haha"
2016-01-17,21:54:24,out,+13132444230,Tori Jovanovski,"Haha it is, although is that really how you want to advertise Detroit? ""Detroit: probably more interesting than Montana"""
2016-01-17,22:00:14,in,+13132444230,Tori Jovanovski,"Eh, not really my job to be the tourism bureau here haha"
2016-01-17,22:13:04,out,+19064402540,Taryn MacInnis,Hm... I don't know if you're THAT good ;)

2016-01-17,22:32:08,out,+19064402540,Taryn MacInnis,You sure? I'm probably your biggest success story
2016-01-17,22:32:31,out,+13132444230,Tori Jovanovski,I always wondered what Detroit-ers thought about that one...
2016-01-17,22:49:05,in,+19064402540,Taryn MacInnis,"Lol biggest success story, worst reference"

2016-01-23,11:22:56,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Blatt never really had the locker room, and had really lost it the last month. Lue is the highest-paid assistant in the nba, and was basically being groomed to be head coach. If they'd known LeBron was coming back before choosing a head coach last season, they'd have skipped Blatt and had Lue be coach. And most of all, LeBron respects and likes Lue much more."
2016-01-23,11:30:09,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Gotcha, well that makes a lot of sense then. How was raging with jstarr?"

2016-01-28,09:26:29,in,+12484047416,Stacy,Haha a sexy selfie huh? Alright then let's make it both 
2016-01-28,09:34:21,out,+12533890402,Alex,"To be fair, I think all sandwiches (and Asian cuisine) qualify as good hangover food haha"
2016-01-28,09:35:29,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,How're things on the lady front for you? You better stay single until our NOLA trip!

2016-01-28,19:52:53,in,+12533890402,Alex,Hahaha yes it is!! Actually 9 is super late...
2016-01-28,20:19:42,out,+12533890402,Alex,You're on a clock that's about 3 hrs offset from mine lol
2016-01-28,20:28:05,in,+12533890402,Alex,Haha so 12 is late for you? 
2016-01-28,21:59:33,out,+12533890402,Alex,"Yeah, but it's still in the realm of possibility haha"
2016-01-28,22:03:18,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,First time I didn't kiss a first date
2016-01-28,22:04:15,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"First off, wow--I almost never go for a kiss on the first date..."
2016-01-28,22:04:26,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Second, is that a good sign or bad sign?"
2016-01-28,22:05:01,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"In my mind a bad one, but I think people have different mindsets going in"
2016-01-28,22:05:39,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"She was fairly cute, a little tall for me but fun. Didn't offer to pay which was offputting even though I expected too"
2016-01-28,22:06:19,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Worth a second date if she's interested?
2016-01-28,22:06:54,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"And yeah, I feel like girls looking for anything substantial won't go for a kiss on the first date. Or I've missed out on a lot of smooches in my life..."
2016-01-28,22:08:30,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Dude you can't make any complaints about that body haha
2016-01-28,22:09:05,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Yeah possibly. Eh, would maybe disagree there as Zoe, christy, Mandy, Jamie, idk pretty much anyone I have dated had wanted first date"
2016-01-28,22:09:08,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,She's southern tho
2016-01-28,22:09:45,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Like a peck or a makeout?
2016-01-28,22:10:04,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,WHo's Jamie?
2016-01-28,22:10:16,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Also, I think college expectations might be a bit different?"
2016-01-28,22:11:45,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Girl I dated before Mandy. That's possible!
2016-01-28,22:12:41,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Ehh, usually just a little bit, dependent on which girl"
2016-01-28,22:12:47,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,She was nice aside from the check thing
2016-01-28,22:19:31,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,haha there's definitely a himym episode about that. Can't find the clip...
2016-01-28,22:19:42,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,You looking for fun or serious with her?
2016-01-28,22:21:41,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,I know exactly what you're talking about
2016-01-28,22:21:46,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,The check dance
2016-01-28,22:22:06,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"She must not be looking for fun if she's not down to kiss first date, idk just didn't get any signals"
2016-01-28,22:30:08,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Well, you'll know within 3 days if she's into it, depending on whether she texts you"
2016-01-28,22:31:04,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"I mean... I would have to reach out first saying I had a nice time, no?"
2016-01-28,22:33:16,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Yep. But the substance and timing of her response will tell you everything.
2016-01-28,22:34:01,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Also, I've had multiple girls in detroit blow off the ""I had a nice time"" text, wait 2-3 days, then be super interested in texting all of a sudden. I think that's a good sign."
2016-01-28,22:37:02,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Haha alright, I'll text her now"
2016-01-28,22:37:30,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Make sure you include a picture of your dick as well
2016-01-28,22:37:43,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Fuck
2016-01-28,22:39:36,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,That was quick
2016-01-28,22:40:24,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Wow, she ain't playing games"
2016-01-28,22:41:04,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Yeah seriously
2016-01-28,22:41:47,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Honestly it sounds bullshitty but I think her showing up late without notice and not offering to pay are kinda bad signs for me
2016-01-28,22:41:51,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,Been awhile since a first date for me
2016-01-28,22:42:47,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Yeah... I would speculate that maybe those were power plays, but if she isn't playing games while texting, maybe that's just how she's wired"
2016-01-28,23:15:23,out,+12484047416,Stacy,Are you a fan of standup?
2016-01-28,23:16:28,in,+12484047416,Stacy,I think so... Haha I have only been to one show but it was a lot of fun!

2016-01-28,23:21:22,out,+12484047416,Stacy,Hm... 10:30 one still has some tickets?
2016-01-28,23:21:51,out,+12484047416,Stacy,Oh so it's a pretty solid place?
2016-01-28,23:25:36,in,+12484047416,Stacy,I think it depends more on who is playing lol 
2016-01-28,23:26:34,in,+12484047416,Stacy,"But I think I can do the 10:30, can I let you know for sure tomorrow? "
2016-01-28,23:44:46,out,+12484047416,Stacy,"Fair enough. And yeah, that works :)"

2016-02-19,11:46:17,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Yeah lol, definitely not in the bag at the point. If anything, it was the opposite. Maybe I'll try it out on Angela"
2016-02-19,12:12:00,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Yeah it's okay, they always seem to target me though"
2016-02-19,12:49:21,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Lol what do you mean ""target""? I think that makes me want to go there even more..."

2016-02-21,11:17:13,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,You downloaded it?? 
2016-02-21,11:17:49,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Well yeah but the sign up is picky
2016-02-21,11:47:46,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Haha how so? 
2016-02-21,11:48:13,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Email says mine is taken.

2016-02-21,15:16:54,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Yeah but anyway I was able to send you the link how do you like the music in case you already looked at it
2016-02-21,15:28:24,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,"Yeah I got it! Just listened to it. Not my kind of music, but still good! "
2016-02-21,15:29:19,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,It's a good motivational thing to listen to when you need to get work done that's how I use it also it's a good way to build confidence within yourself lol
2016-02-21,15:30:23,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,I'll send you my favorite work music 
2016-02-21,15:31:05,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Sounds good. I guess you're not into electronic metal are you I am guessing?
2016-02-21,15:49:22,out,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,Eh not really
2016-02-21,15:50:14,out,+15172404792,+15172404792,Ugh that's no good. What're you going to school for? 
2016-02-21,15:50:19,in,+14406653631,David Clough Jr.,That's the type of Celldweller is to so Blue Stahli is basically the same as Celldweller.
2016-02-21,15:51:33,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Starting to think you did this on purpose... 
2016-02-21,16:00:28,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,You caught me. I control the weather. It has nothing to do with it being February in the Midwest ;)
2016-02-21,16:41:20,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Nooo I was talking about some very telling markings you left on me haha 
2016-02-21,16:42:44,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Ohhhh! Shit, that was not on purpose haha"
2016-02-21,19:49:34,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Well, my retaliation won't be on purpose either ;)"
2016-02-21,19:55:10,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Hey did I respond to your last text? Just found out my phone has been dropping texts lately... If not, sorry to bother you lol"
2016-02-21,20:15:16,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Nooo it was an accident I swear!
2016-02-21,21:37:10,in,+12168494536,Rene Polin,Excellent. Great seeing you!
2016-02-21,22:07:32,out,+12168494536,Rene Polin,Same here! 
2016-02-21,23:46:29,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Also I just realized we're already even. I just don't walk around without a shirt often so I hadn't noticed...
2016-02-22,00:28:30,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Wow you must bruise really easily. Because I was actively trying to not leave any marks
2016-02-22,10:32:55,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Yeah I do, but there's only a couple and they're not bad. I don't really care as long as it's not on the neck or it's swimsuit season haha"
2016-02-22,18:31:05,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Do you think my laptop is powerful enough to handle the oculus rift?
2016-02-22,18:31:34,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"My mom's a bad influence too, she's trying to get me to drink for national margarita day üòë"
2016-02-22,18:40:50,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Well it was almost bathing suit weather on Saturday! 
2016-02-22,18:41:07,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Haha just give in!! 
2016-02-22,18:41:34,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Most likely. Do they give recommended specs online? 
2016-02-22,18:43:34,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Most likely. I just saw an add for the vive or something but rift seems a lot better and more future proof. Does it come with controllers?
2016-02-22,18:46:50,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Idk. I just got the gear vr. Rift looks amazing. 
2016-02-22,19:01:23,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Yeahhh they would've still been covered by a swimsuit lol
2016-02-22,19:01:30,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,And I'm so close I'm not giving in!
2016-02-22,19:03:58,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Ya it does. And it will run on my laptop üòä but I'm upset I wanted the controllers to come with it. 

Have you seen any upcoming games? They look amazing "
2016-02-22,19:20:39,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,We should make controllers 
2016-02-22,19:20:47,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,That's one of my business ideas
2016-02-22,19:21:11,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,You should get an occulus just so I can try it haha
2016-02-22,19:21:35,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Haha I was pretty preoccupied by those areas ;)
2016-02-22,19:26:06,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Pre order only and it'll be shipped in July. And I guess they didn't make the controllers right away because most of the early game devs built games around traditional controllers
2016-02-22,19:29:04,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Sounds like a market opportunity to me
2016-02-22,19:31:03,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I think you'll have a better head start if you create an immersive treadmill that lets you run around while playing without leaving your room 
2016-02-22,19:48:16,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Haha yeah you definitely were, I'm not mad about it ;)"
2016-02-22,19:59:56,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Too ambitious and expensive. I want to sell 3d printers and modular electronics that fit into a platform where people can design custom controllers from templates that come with games 
2016-02-22,20:00:27,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"To be fair, you also left marks on my breasts"
2016-02-22,20:03:02,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,That would be sick. Custom controllers specific to the individual 
2016-02-22,20:08:58,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Your breasts lolz
2016-02-22,20:14:15,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Also I really didn't mean to leave any marks. They're your fault
2016-02-22,21:45:24,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"I never bruise. You can hit me in the thigh with a hammer, and it won't leave a mark. You must have the sucking power of a shop vac haha"
2016-02-22,21:46:11,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Yep. Call of duty comes with a base gun, but then you can mod it as much as you want. There would be a market place where you could buy/sell designs. We make money off the hardware, and sell our own designs."
2016-02-22,21:50:57,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Is there a product like that already available?
2016-02-22,21:56:03,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,What about different colored LEDs that can glow and whatever on the gun changing how it looks depending on what level you have unlocked 
2016-02-22,21:58:08,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Hahaha one, weird frame of reference. Do you give yourself shop vac hickeys often? ;)  Two, I would have been more careful if you hadn't distracted me so much. Three, can we test the hammer claim?"
2016-02-22,22:14:03,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Nah, it makes too much noise. And the smaller vacuums just don't do the job"
2016-02-22,22:14:25,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Haha if you insist, I'll try not to ""distract"" you next time ;)"
2016-02-22,22:15:26,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Lol I'd prefer we not test the hammer claim, but give me enough drinks, and I'll probably insist that we do"
2016-02-22,22:15:39,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Not that I know of. Market doesn't exist yet. But it might soon...
2016-02-22,22:16:20,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Haha what good would LED's do if you're wearing VR goggles? But we could make sure that game developers allow you to import the design into the game so that it matches your controller...
2016-02-22,22:23:25,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,How many drinks is enough? And you'd better not lol
2016-02-23,12:07:36,in,+12168494536,Rene Polin,"We didn't get one of the two projects, Still in running for the other...I could use some prayers today!"
2016-02-23,12:08:30,out,+12168494536,Rene Polin,Damn.... You've got them. Let me know how it goes. 
2016-02-23,12:08:57,in,+12168494536,Rene Polin,Thanks man.
2016-02-23,12:28:46,out,5862152075,Kyle Grager,Eating? 
2016-02-23,12:29:00,in,+15862152075,Kyle Grager,Pooping... I'm gonna go home to eat though. 
2016-02-23,12:33:24,out,+15862152075,Kyle Grager,Haha good luck 
2016-02-23,12:33:53,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Haha probably when I can't speak anymore 
2016-02-23,12:34:09,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,At that point I'll definitely be unable to distract you lol
2016-02-23,13:04:47,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Hmmm okay challenge accepted
2016-02-23,15:23:52,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Gonna be hard to get me to drink that much if you aren't drinking at all... 
2016-02-23,15:59:41,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Damn it. I guess I'll have to see how resourceful I am
2016-02-23,16:07:38,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I'm thinking augmented reality has much more use than virtual reality. For instance imagine a Pokemon fight with life sized pikachu and charizard in your back yard. AR also means harder programming.   And the LEDs were more for show lol 
2016-02-23,17:45:56,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I think good AR is still 3-4 yrs away though
2016-02-23,18:33:29,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Man that's an eternity away
2016-02-23,20:24:11,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Yeah. The hololens is like $3k and has a really narrow pov 
2016-02-23,20:42:05,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"I guess if you have the fortitude to lace up those boots everyday, you can probably do anything haha"
2016-02-23,20:53:34,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Maybe I should start saving up now
2016-02-23,21:00:22,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Or just be prepared to sell your truck lol. How's life in Kent right now? 
2016-02-23,21:04:39,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,It's still in the same place. Hasn't really moved anywhere since I last visited 
2016-02-23,21:18:51,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Damn straight. Those aren't even my most intricate shoes...
2016-02-23,21:50:04,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Broski just thought of a great invention. Kinda sucks that in today's world it's needed but hey I don't make the world I just live in it
2016-02-23,21:53:08,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Some kinda sensor, infrared, sonar, idc doesn't really matter. Either built into the phone case or somehow incorporated into the camera, that can detect things on the floor in front of you and will alert you while you're walking with your head down outside on your phone. "
2016-02-23,21:53:53,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Like this
2016-02-23,21:55:05,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"It'll detect changes to the grid, and depending on its programming, will alert you if the squares become too misshapen/there's some kind of obstacle directly ahead"
2016-02-23,22:10:37,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"That's how the kinect works actually, although in the infrared range. I think Lenovo and Google are going to roll out a phone with such a depth sensor, so that app would definitely work on that phone! "
2016-02-23,22:11:02,out,+12168494536,Rene Polin,Any word on project #2?
2016-02-23,22:11:24,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Dude let's draw it up. Imagine how many people will be able to walk and scroll Facebook with confidence 
2016-02-23,22:11:39,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Haha do you have boots tied with rubics cubes or something? 
2016-02-23,22:13:02,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"With the angle that you usually hold your phone, do you think the camera would see obstacles in time? "
2016-02-23,22:13:52,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,No. You'd need a wide angle lens or a mirror
2016-02-23,22:14:19,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,And currently my upper half of my phone is bent downwards so it'll be even harder 
2016-02-23,22:14:50,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Lol how'd that happen
2016-02-23,22:15:40,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Idk it's subtle so it might have taken place over months 
2016-02-23,22:15:54,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,How about wearable tech?
2016-02-23,22:16:35,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Lol would you buy a $70 wearable accessory to help you not walk into things? 
2016-02-23,22:17:47,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Better off getting a pool floatie for $7
2016-02-23,22:19:09,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Okay so phone app. How about a phone case with a wide angle lens built in? Or should we just ask people to hold their phones a little higher by
2016-02-23,22:21:35,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Actually the viewing angle might be alright. I just walked around with the camera on and it was far enough away. I'm also tall as balls so the incident angle was a little steeper than normal 
2016-02-23,22:28:00,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Your height means you can see farther though... I don't think you'd have much luck asking people to buy a case
2016-02-23,22:29:07,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Also, not to burst your bubble, but:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/type-n-walk/id331043123?mt=8"
2016-02-23,22:29:15,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Ya I know which means my view of it will be artificially better than the general public. But still I don't think a case will be necessary. 
2016-02-23,22:30:10,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Bubble restored 
2016-02-23,22:31:22,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,We'll call it nudge. 
2016-02-23,22:31:26,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"No, just more laces. I would consider the rubik cube ones though. If I could solve them..."
2016-02-23,22:31:51,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,One setback is if you're walking with a group of ppl. 
2016-02-23,22:55:23,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I'm feeling that it's a disproportionately complex solution compared to the scope of the problem... 
2016-02-23,22:55:49,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,If only I could wear them everywhere and they weren't super uncomfortable
2016-02-23,22:57:40,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Well darn 
2016-02-23,23:05:19,in,+12168494536,Rene Polin,Nothing yet
2016-02-23,23:23:40,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Those are insane 
2016-02-23,23:24:37,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,There are some things I'll never be able to understand haha
2016-02-23,23:31:09,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"They're my favorites. So cute. Also, it's okay not to get it. It shows you don't have a weird shoe or foot fetish. Unless you're acting in the extreme opposite to cover one up haha"
2016-02-24,00:05:15,in,+19143745260,Justin Starr,Dude we have to talk after I get back from this trip - I have so many ridiculous stories. I seriously hope I'm never part of a demo as disastrous as this ever again haha 
2016-02-24,00:33:02,out,+19143745260,Justin Starr,"Oh man... When it gets so bad that you aren't even upset, I get scared"
2016-02-24,01:36:20,in,+19143745260,Justin Starr,Yeah it's been a disaster - so bad but I'm pretty much numb to it at this point. 1 more day of being shit on by the customer then I get to go home haha
2016-02-24,13:16:34,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,You disagree? 
2016-02-24,13:17:52,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Nope, you're the only one here with a shoe fetish ;)"
2016-02-24,13:18:16,out,+19143745260,Justin Starr,"Wow, it must have been really really bad"
2016-02-24,14:30:29,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Whatevs, it's not a fetish shoes complete an outfit lol"
2016-02-24,15:07:42,in,+19143745260,Justin Starr,Finally worked today! So exhausted but so relieved 
2016-02-24,15:07:50,in,+19143745260,Justin Starr,"Have some pretty funny ""war stories"""
2016-02-24,17:45:37,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,When do I get more bit time
2016-02-24,17:45:44,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Chicago this weekend?
2016-02-24,17:49:09,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Nah I just wanted it to work
2016-02-24,18:02:41,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Don't have Friday off :/
2016-02-24,18:02:47,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Come to the D
2016-02-24,18:02:59,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Is it fun
2016-02-24,18:03:07,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Haha I know the feeling
2016-02-24,18:07:25,in,+18105162801,Bill Beyer,How is it out there? About to pack up
2016-02-24,18:13:54,out,+18105162801,Bill Beyer,Not terrible. See ya soon
2016-02-24,18:19:55,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"So I did the math. If I want to be a billionaire by the time I'm 60 I'll need to make $75,000 a day from now until then "
2016-02-24,18:29:35,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,So what's the plan for tomorrow's 75k?
2016-02-24,18:30:08,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,"Eh, it's no Chicago. But I'll try to pull something together. "
2016-02-24,18:30:22,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Well, I'm going to start packing a lunch instead of buying. That'll save me $15..."
2016-02-24,18:32:00,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,So that gets you 0.002% of the way there lol
2016-02-24,18:33:41,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,And hey since I have 4 days off per week without any possibility of overtime any longer I was looking into 2nd job ideas. My dad suggested working at a Marriott. You can stay anywhere for only  35 if you're an employee
2016-02-24,18:39:42,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"That's not going to make you a billionaire either lol. My advice would be to pick up coding, if it interests you"
2016-02-24,18:40:49,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Well see I'm thinking it won't be a linear engagement. More asymptotic, building up capital then turning pennies into hundreds "
2016-02-24,18:52:35,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,I am free this weekend
2016-02-24,19:06:56,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Depends on your field, I think. "
2016-02-24,19:07:26,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Me too! Could you be here by Friday evening?

2016-02-24,19:11:01,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,I could come tomorrow late night and work from the d on Friday
2016-02-24,19:11:10,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,I'll try to borrow my cousins car
2016-02-24,19:11:16,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,But you coming to chi is better

2016-02-24,19:23:16,out,+12162331991,Ian Malave,Yeah it's nasty. We were allowed to leave work early today
2016-02-24,19:31:04,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Yeah, ok, and handcuffs complete my police uniform haha"
2016-02-24,19:31:51,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,I wouldn't be able to arrive for Friday night stuff. And it's too far for one night of fun

2016-02-24,21:57:03,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Haha I don't see the difference
2016-02-24,21:57:20,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Got any plans this weekend? 
2016-02-24,22:09:48,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"I'm ignoring that because I'm right and your example was ridiculous üòú I work Saturday but that's it, you?"
2016-02-24,22:37:57,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"If I show up next time in a police uniform, then I have a case haha"
2016-02-24,22:38:44,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,And it's surprisingly open :)
2016-02-24,22:40:47,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Want to do something Saturday night?
2016-02-24,22:41:31,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"If you actually show up in a police uniform, I would probably give up not drinking this month"
2016-02-24,23:49:28,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"So I feel like you 1) dropped another text/fell asleep, 2) found better plans, or 3) got sidetracked tracking down a police uniform. I'm kind of hoping it's option 1..."
2016-02-24,23:56:12,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Orrrr 4) I was playing guitar/watching basketball instead of checking my phone haha. Saturday works for me :)
2016-02-24,23:57:00,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"I can pick out a uniform tomorrow, this is why I pay for Amazon prime "
2016-02-24,23:57:36,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Just let me know soon so that I can call my 3 friends and make something happen haha
2016-02-24,23:58:51,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,"Also, maybe my Tinder girl can find a friend :) If so, and if she hooks up with you, I win"
2016-02-24,23:59:17,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,I'll look into megabus
2016-02-25,00:00:28,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Hahaha because what other reason would there be to have prime?
2016-02-25,00:00:43,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,It's 6 hours :/
2016-02-25,00:02:26,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Amtrak? 
2016-02-25,00:03:36,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,Also I felt I had to check. I'm about to fall asleep and I feel bad when I do in the middle of making plans. Now it doesn't matter though so goodnight :)
2016-02-25,00:04:49,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Well, based on my order history, there are about 150 other reasons to have prime haha"
2016-02-25,00:06:05,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,5:41
2016-02-25,00:06:12,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Man, I'll never be able to ghost you, because you'll just keep saying, ""hey not sure if my last text went through, but..."" haha"
2016-02-25,00:06:58,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,But it's comfy and you can work? 5:41 train is better than 4 hrs in a car
2016-02-25,00:10:03,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,That is true. I can go Friday then and arrive at 2 pm
2016-02-25,00:10:09,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,When do you get off work
2016-02-25,00:10:19,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,I think there are no trains for tomorrow
2016-02-25,00:34:01,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,"Technically not till 6. But I can work through lunch, then pick you up and bring you to my place, then go back to work for a couple hours"
2016-02-25,00:34:21,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Make sure there's something reasonable on Sunday too
2016-02-25,00:49:08,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,True that. So I'm looking at stocks right meow. Mostly in tech. Only problem is that most of the tech that will do exceptionally well is still privately owned.   However.   Caterpillar (the construction company) recently unveiled that they are working on a new smartphone. Supposed to be indestructible and waterproof. It comes out in June. The stocks for caterpillar have dropped since last year but I think with this tech and its subsequent release that it'll get back.  If I buy this week and hold out a few months after its release I should be able to sell at a profit. Think it's a safe bet? Lol
2016-02-25,10:26:35,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Well, I'm not too savvy of an investor, so you probably shouldn't take advice from me. I do know you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket. I personally would be wary of a construction company trying to break into the mobile market. Last company to try that was Amazon, who was much better positioned than CAT, and they got fucking destroyed. But you never know. "
2016-02-25,10:26:59,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Also, Samsung s5 was waterproof, and no one cared"
2016-02-25,13:32:09,in,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,"Haha have you ever gone into a store? And you can, but not in the middle of making plans when I want to go to bed ;)"
2016-02-25,13:35:13,out,2078524607,Dacie Manion,"Wow, not even giving excuses for skipping the gym now eh? "
2016-02-25,13:53:46,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp, Yea I've been thinking it over some more... Probably not the best idea. Maybe with a couple stocks but not anything crazy. A better bet would be something like Disney. It's always rising plus with 2 more Star Wars movies I'm sure it'll get even higher
2016-02-25,14:12:11,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,The thing with the caterpillar phone is that it's the first phone ever to have infrared technology so I'm thinking it has to be a big release
2016-02-25,14:38:42,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,You're mutual friends
2016-02-25,14:56:43,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,I don't remember her... 
2016-02-25,14:57:04,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,I saw an Indian girl yesterday where you were a mutual friend
2016-02-25,14:57:21,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Name
2016-02-25,15:22:08,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Don't remember. Not cute. Possibly med student? 
2016-02-25,15:24:58,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,If I came o Detroit a great weekend would be some beer pong with your Bria and concubines
2016-02-25,15:25:03,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Bros
2016-02-25,15:43:32,out,+12489305639,Katie Oyama,I bought milk at the store once. Then Google Express was invented and now I never have to go to a store again :)
2016-02-25,15:46:46,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,"All of my bros are engineers. But if you can live with that, I'll make it happen haha. Are you thinking this weekend still or next? "
2016-02-25,15:47:13,in,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,I had a call for tomorrow morning that I handled today. This weekend will be better
2016-02-25,15:47:33,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Amazon had some novel hardware as well, but people won't buy the phone for a feature they'll use 1% of the time "
2016-02-25,15:47:57,out,+14129569470,Karl Rosario,Sweet! Should I start orchestrating? 
2016-02-25,15:51:22,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,True. It blows I wanted to invest in a police body camera company but all the public companies are on the decline. If I did this last summer I could have tripled my money
2016-02-25,15:55:42,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Yeah you can really only win if you're ahead of the public somehow
2016-02-25,15:57:06,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I think Nike would be a solid investment. Hasn't had a down year since 2008 and its stock is cheaper than caterpillar lol
2016-02-25,16:04:21,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Cheaper than both is lions gate entertainment. The movie company. They dropped 50% in value over the last 5 months due to their last hunger games movie being released the same time as Star Wars. They lost  100 million in revenue so the stock bottomed out. I'm thinking now would be a good time to buy

2016-03-17,23:43:27,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Well to be fair I think one of the best side hobbies to do for money is to raise horses. 
2016-03-17,23:43:37,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Actually, not really... "
2016-03-17,23:44:11,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Haha I think you need some expertise for that
2016-03-17,23:44:27,out,+19414055914,Austin Childs,Hey we don't pretend to be good at any sport haha
2016-03-17,23:45:16,in,+19414055914,Austin Childs,Did you watch the game? Crazy 3 to send it to overtime
2016-03-17,23:45:39,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,True
2016-03-17,23:45:42,in,+15083245310,Joe Hill,It'll be fun tho
2016-03-17,23:47:09,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"True enough. But if you raise a good polo pony you could sell it for anywhere between $30,000-$50,000 or maybe even higher "
2016-03-17,23:47:26,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Multiply that by the number of horses you have and you got yourself a good side job
2016-03-17,23:48:04,out,+19414055914,Austin Childs,"Damn, I haven't been able to watch anything. On a work trip. Will have to catch highlights "

2016-03-17,23:50:28,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"It's a side thing! Lol. You need capital to start up and land. But as far as raising animals for money you can't do much better than horses. Plus if you have a really good one like with the horse named I'll have another, you can sell its DNA to cloners for millions "
2016-03-17,23:51:48,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Sounds like high risk high reward 
2016-03-17,23:53:31,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Like the stock market, or putting 20% of my paycheck for my 401k"
2016-03-17,23:57:33,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,401k is low risk low reward right? 
2016-03-17,23:58:59,in,+19414055914,Austin Childs,Same. Only looked up that one play. I'm at work while the games are on...

2016-03-18,17:53:23,in,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,Ok thanks! It's a one-time fee right not per game? And the 6wk season is t like 1game every week or 6 games during a 8-12 week season?

They've been poor the last 4 years but apparently they just fired about 500 people and are replacing them with robots so they're projected profits are through the roof.   Best part is that it's only  6 a share. So if they end up going tits up its not as bad as a more expensive stock

2016-03-20,19:59:24,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I want to buy and rent out a house in Kent but that's a little out of my price range. Talk about an easy mode of income whilst in medical school

2016-03-20,20:25:00,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Well it's a big undertaking. Ideally you'll make  1k a month or more thru rent so you'll make your money back in time then make straight profit but it takes a lot of capital up front 
2016-03-20,20:30:06,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Hopefully you're still alive when that happens haha
2016-03-20,20:32:55,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Actually for Kent you could probably get away with 2k a month if you had enough people. Get a few houses like that and you got yourself a good side business
2016-03-20,21:12:44,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"For someone who doesn't want to make an investment over $10, that's a mighty hefty commitment"

2016-03-21,14:42:53,out,+15864828588,Bill Beyer,Gotcha. Should I do the same? 
2016-03-21,15:03:34,out,+17738226749,Anna Christianson,Real talk usually isn't about great things. But that's what makes it so necessary 
2016-03-21,15:03:39,out,+17738226749,Anna Christianson,That's not good! Glad you made it haha
2016-03-21,15:03:53,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,When hot girls get hit on non stop by douchebags they kind of get a natural response of being shitty to any guy they meet regardless of what their intentions happen to be. It's an adaptive behavior. If a hot girl interacted with every guy that walked up to her she'd have no time for herself. So they create a bitch shield. Don't worry tho I'll get you passed it

2016-03-23,14:24:49,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Idk. She's just a little much. Uses words like always and never. Like we're never breaking up and you're always going to be with me. And now she's talking about marriage 
2016-03-23,14:25:32,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,lol those midwest girls are almost as bad as southern girls. Have you talked to her about it?
2016-03-23,14:29:06,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Not well enough it would seem. Idk. It's like I wanna marry up or even with me you know? Like a nurse or a doc or someone in the sciences or something. She just got a job at Walmart. So idk

2016-03-23,15:35:30,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I don't think either of us could marry someone who didn't have the confidence or ability to support herself. Huge turn-off. But you should totally date her long enough for me to meet her friend lol

2016-03-23,15:40:15,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,She is. But she just seems too detached from the real world. Like with her beliefs and what not. Idk. And id feel bad about dating her for a while and not marrying her because her best quality is her looks and that won't be around forever

If you do that, then all you have to worry about is whether you're enjoying the relationship. If so, keep going. If not, then stop.

Initially he was trying to find the splitter, which is why I called you. But he ended up identifying the face plate on the wall as the issue, and he's just about done repairing it. So we should be all good. "
2016-04-03,18:24:52,in,+12698062854,Rich Boven,Nice!  Thanks for taking care of it.

2016-04-03,21:50:08,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Reverse plot twist: I already lost all of my gambling money betting on the NCAA games last night. Take that!
2016-04-03,22:03:40,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Haha which game killed you??

2016-04-03,22:59:49,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Hahaha even on a hiatus, girls ""accidentally"" push their tits into him -.- pretty much just like being at a strip club"
2016-04-04,09:48:34,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Haha I can think of a few minor differences between that and a strip club, but I don't think he was complaining either way "
2016-04-04,10:40:33,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Loll idk sounds like a heavy 'bosom' to bear üòú (oh god pls laugh). So you have friends visiting again this weekend right?
2016-04-04,12:47:27,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"I give up, no idea what you're getting at there haha"
2016-04-04,12:48:09,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"I had a friend who said he might, but he's the least reliable person ever, so I'll believe it when he knocks on my door"

2016-04-04,14:23:48,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Like heavy ""burden"" but bosom cuz of all the weight of the boobs...I feel so weird sending this explanation text haha"
2016-04-04,16:23:57,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Ah... I actually thought that might be it. But then I figured that you have a pretty good sense of humor, so it had to be something else ;)"

2016-04-04,16:50:13,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,The best sense of humor is saying something dumb and being able to laugh at yourself üòú! or so I tell myself. When no one else laughs.
2016-04-04,17:26:45,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Haha that's a pretty good definition. But then how do I know whether I have a good sense of humor if they always laugh? 
2016-04-04,19:15:28,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Oh...that's probably just pity..if anyone at work makes even the slightest joke I laugh like its the funniest thing in the world. Those poor souls, they need it"
2016-04-04,20:56:55,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,That might be a preferable explanation; the alternative is that I have the same sense of humor as a bunch of nerdy engineers...
2016-04-04,20:57:36,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"You make your office sound pretty depressing, but the people I met Saturday seemed like they'd be pretty fun to work with?"
2016-04-04,21:30:35,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Haha awwe. I think we have a similar sense of humor..maybe that's why you keep saying it's good. I don't feel so good now that you're comparing me to a nerdy engineer..
2016-04-04,21:31:53,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"And I was just kidding. Work can be pretty depressing sometimes, and I also don't work with anyone from my office (esp the young ones). Like that one Asian isn't really consulting haha"
2016-04-04,21:42:20,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,I think I made it clear on Saturday that I don't think of you as a nerdy engineer ;)
2016-04-04,21:42:56,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Oh really? That sucks, the only saving grace of my job is that I work with a few young, cool people. Maybe you ought to quit and come work for the government..."
2016-04-04,22:22:23,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Haha what do you think of me as then :p and that's actually surprising to me, I would think the gov is full of geezers..I've been thinking a lot about quitting recently, too many white hairs from stress..I should work at a place that lets me take naps during training"

2016-04-05,20:18:46,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,I think you're right that it's hard to get to know people through texting. I don't really know you so don't want to bother you. I'm happy to chat and get to know each other better
2016-04-05,21:06:43,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,"Fair enough. I don't usually do this, but how about we skip the texting and grab a drink sometime? "
2016-04-05,21:15:42,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Lol well I feel honored! We could definitely do that. Are you from around Royal Oak?

2016-04-05,21:59:37,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Haha you mean I pretend to like my job? Yeah I've only recently started seriously thinking about it but it's still a really scary idea
2016-04-05,21:59:56,out,+18479171051,Mike Bellino,Does that mean two of us ref or something?
2016-04-05,22:06:17,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,That sounds nice! I'm not positive about this weekend though. I have to work a little Saturday morning and am busy that evening. Potentially Sunday but I might have family stuff going on this weekend (my mom is sad when I don't come visit at least once on the weekend lol) but if not this weekend then maybe one night next week or that weekend?
2016-04-05,22:32:38,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,"No worries, I've got a fairly full weekend as well. Early next week (Mon or Wed) could work for me?"

2016-04-05,23:26:43,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Bahaha you mean the government doesn't wine and dine you? And well...that's not really true. After a couple of years it becomes up or out - but sure I will try to milk it for as long as I can...but it's a little miserable haha
2016-04-05,23:26:57,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Like you probably get to go home at a reasonable time, get a work out, not feel stressed.."

2016-04-08,17:19:12,in,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,"Or is it more cool üòâ I can be a pretty good wingwoman myself you'll see...I realized recently that I can introduce u to several women in Ann Arbor - one I graduated with (not currently single but about to be because her bf from this winter is moving far away in a month or so and they don't want to do distance) and she has several female friends. She's smart, cute, and fun. 

Oh and Marv is a fantastic wingman"

2016-04-10,18:27:44,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Yes! Wednesday would work well for me. I have a meeting in Troy at 4 so we could meet for a drink after if you want?

2016-04-10,19:01:44,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"That's good, sounds more fun than being at home by yourself! The concert was really good..one of my friends disappeared for 2 hrs and came back out of control crazy and can't explain what he did...I feel like he either chugged a fifth by himself or got drugged üò≥"
2016-04-10,19:06:10,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Man...it's a little disheartening listening to someone attempt to wretch eugh...I think her friend should've stepped in to help her finish the job..
2016-04-10,20:29:57,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Lol that works but I'm an old lady and go to sleep early so I can't be out too late üëµüèº

2016-04-10,23:35:40,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"In the short term, that's pretty concerning. In the long term, that has the makings for a really funny story."
2016-04-10,23:36:11,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Haha that's why you have friends, right? Maybe you should have been a good samaritan and lent a hand (literally)"
2016-04-11,07:35:56,in,+14404525639,Mary Clough,Looks like a feast!
2016-04-11,07:45:27,in,+15174203402,Ari Grayson,"Haha it can't be that bad! What did you do? I am ok, I came back  home yesterday and started feeling sick"

2016-04-11,08:13:35,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Alright well that works for me! Do you work late during the week?
2016-04-11,09:02:27,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,"Great! Not terribly, but by the time I get out of work, workout, shower, and eat dinner, it's closer to 8ish. Guessing you don't want me to skip the shower haha"

2016-04-11,15:04:35,out,+15174203402,Ari Grayson,"I made Thai red curry with chicken, and steak for Philly cheese steaks. I didn't get food poisoning yet, so I'll call it a win haha."

2016-04-11,19:27:25,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Lmao that is true. I'm sure there are some pretty good tinder date blogs out there already
2016-04-11,19:50:48,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Haha there has to be a buzzfeed or something. Hopefully I'm not on it...
2016-04-11,19:51:25,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,"You know, you're making me really nervous lol"

2016-04-11,19:52:27,out,5174203402,Ari Grayson,And breakfast for dinner is one of the most underrated things in life
2016-04-11,19:57:08,in,+15174203402,Ari Grayson,"Yes, bacon and Nutella/bread! "
2016-04-11,19:57:29,in,+15174203402,Ari Grayson,"And not really, everyone here is pretty old. It is bad the lake but not warm enough :("
2016-04-11,21:09:47,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Yeah...we were worried for about 10 seconds. Just another degenerate weekend üôÑ I don't lend services with my hands THAT freely..she needs to earn that ;) 
2016-04-11,21:11:05,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"That sandwich looks delicious, you are on a roll. Are you trying to get featured on chowwithtao?"
2016-04-11,21:59:57,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"She should have taken you to a comedy show, I heard that does the trick ;)"
2016-04-11,22:01:24,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Was that pun intentional, or are you just that good? As for chowwithtao...I think I'd like to get published by someone with a few more followers ;P"
2016-04-11,22:02:55,out,5174203402,Ari Grayson,Bacon and Nutella are objectively the two best foods on earth. I'd be worried that eating them at the same time might cause some kind of explosion or nuclear event.
2016-04-11,22:03:08,out,5174203402,Ari Grayson,Haha I guess that's why they need hot tubs!
2016-04-11,22:03:30,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Just setting the expectation bar nice and low haha
2016-04-11,22:13:38,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,"Lmao nice. In all honesty, previous tinder date has already done that for you. In my roommates words, ""it can only go up from here"". Lmao but if you do end up being a hairy 40 year old man, I'm giving up on online dating forever."
2016-04-11,23:05:15,in,+15174203402,Ari Grayson,Haha thanks for putting that idea in my mind!!
2016-04-11,23:20:36,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Haha I echo both of those sentiments
2016-04-11,23:22:03,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Haha the real wildcard would be if I ended up being the hairy 40 year old man
2016-04-11,23:29:35,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,"Well if we're both old hairy 40-year old men, maybe we can become good friends. Join each other's fantasy football leagues, drink beer in each other's (mom's) basements, creep on 22-year old girls on Tinder together. We'd have a great time!"
2016-04-11,23:31:02,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,So this is basically win-win
2016-04-11,23:31:08,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,That's what I'm hearing
2016-04-11,23:41:43,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,"I hate to break this to you, but I actually am who I say I am. Hoping you can say the same lol"
2016-04-11,23:41:57,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,"Plus, I already have 2 fantasy football leagues, so that never would have worked out"
2016-04-11,23:42:30,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Lol!
2016-04-11,23:42:43,out,+15174203402,Ari Grayson,"Once you eat something as degenerate as nutella and bacon, you're completely American haha"
2016-04-11,23:42:44,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,Time will only tell...
2016-04-11,23:46:05,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Lol just figured I'd get my arm workout in for the week? *blushes profusely*. And YES JOE it was intentional and I AM just that good.
2016-04-11,23:46:24,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Ouch you really know how to get them where it hurts üòî

2016-04-12,20:10:15,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,"Poyentially. I just finished playing basketball, so anything before 9 would be tough. "

2016-04-12,21:03:15,out,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,I went one block east of main. That's where the meters that take card are

2016-04-12,21:09:03,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Holy shit. I think the estimate I put into my spreadsheet for cost of living needs another zero. 
2016-04-12,21:10:00,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Or two.... $1000/mo for a shipping container?? 
2016-04-12,21:16:50,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Lol yeah wtf right? I love the people living in googles parking lot...it's totally doable and probably not even that uncomfortable considering Google has all the amenities you could ever need
2016-04-12,23:28:03,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"I've read a couple of other stories about google employees who did that. One guy noted how awkward it was to bring girls back to his van haha. In another life, I would have been serious when I said I was living in my car"
2016-04-12,23:31:44,out,+15174203402,Ari Grayson,"I do get a bad feeling after Denny's, but it's usually more intestinal than guilt-related haha. And I haven't yet, but I'll add it to my list :)"
2016-04-12,23:35:53,out,+15174203402,Ari Grayson,I think I should buy a deep-fryer so that I can make chili cheese fries any time I want.
2016-04-12,23:44:52,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Hahaha oh god. I think it'd be kind of impressive in a really weird / engineery sort of way
2016-04-12,23:52:11,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"What, to live in a trailer, or to convince a girl to come back to it? Because the latter is definitely more impressive, provided she's reasonably sane and decently attractive "
2016-04-12,23:52:45,in,+15867385439,Rachel Pharis,"Thank you for the beers, glad you weren't a hairy 40 year old! Goodnight :)"
2016-04-12,23:54:16,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Well I was more speaking from a girls point view..like I'd be weirdly impressed upon seeing the guys abode being a trailer cuz it's hilarious and kind of genius? Why not take advantage of all your company had to offer üòÇ
2016-04-13,07:02:24,in,+15174203402,Ari Grayson,That sounds like a good plan! Last night I slept for almost 9 hours

2016-04-13,18:57:16,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Haha nooo...circumstances a little shady. A random Asian girl fb msgs me and says she found it in the Mexican parking lot but when I get there the server who gives it to me says he found it last week at the FedEx parking lot (where I was). I've never been to the Mexican place
2016-04-13,18:58:00,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Probably took the $5 but whatever, I'm just so happy I have it back üòç the universe only kind of hates me"

2016-04-13,19:47:50,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,That's really sketchy. I'd probably cancel my cards just in case. There's a reason they waited so long 
2016-04-13,19:48:49,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,It really has been torturously lax. Every day feels longer than the last. I'm not built for this haha
2016-04-13,21:22:36,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Yeah I already did...she sounds super sketch, said she was too lazy to tell me the whole story. Awwe I'm sorry to hear that :( you were built to make millions of dollars preying on gambling addicts"

2016-04-13,23:39:20,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Ah, my idea only works if the purchase doesn't match your buying history. Maybe buy some basketball shoes for me?"

Like I'm trying so hard to find time and I'm just keeping my schedule so packed that I really don't have time. I know that sounds like an excuse but I think it's just bad timing. I thought I was ready to start dating again but the reason I'm single in the first place is because I didn't have time for a relationship. Apparently that's still the case for me."

2016-04-28,15:32:49,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Hahaha that's kinda cool..but it sounds like you took out the fun and doubled the nerdiness
2016-04-28,18:43:52,in,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,Lol ok let me check with my friend Audrey and see if there's anything fun going on there this weekend and I'll get back to u :)
2016-04-28,20:30:53,out,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,Sounds good! 
2016-04-28,20:31:32,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,You say that as if those things are mutually exclusive ;)
2016-04-28,20:31:55,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Up to do something this weekend? 
2016-04-28,21:45:44,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,I have plans Friday but I'm free Saturday and Sunday..Im still holding you Tupperware hostage 
2016-04-28,22:15:38,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Yeah that's the only reason I asked, you can even just drop them off if I'm not home, and then I won't even need to see you"
2016-04-28,22:16:15,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,But Saturday should be good for me :)
2016-04-28,22:17:10,out,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,"If it makes any difference, tomorrow would be better for me..."
2016-04-28,22:40:31,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"Haha meanie, at least I don't have to walk through your smelly shoe rack in that case!"
2016-04-28,23:32:51,in,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,Ohh I work tomorrow :/ how's tomorrow evening for u though?
2016-04-29,03:15:32,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"So get this right. My phone doesn't have enough 'storage' to take a picture. So It won't even let me use the camera. At all. But I can go on snap chat and take a photo then save that photo to my photo library. So I ask you, what is the logic behind that Tom fuckery?"
2016-04-29,07:47:01,out,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,Haha that's what I meant. Works for me! 
2016-04-29,07:47:33,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Um... Snapchat saves smaller photos maybe? 
2016-04-29,09:18:27,in,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,"Ah gotcha sounds good. I should be home around 6:30, we can take my car cuz Marv will want to come and go for a walk we like the parks in AA. ;) walk and dinner sound good to u? "
2016-04-29,10:52:41,out,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,"It does sound good! I might have to play it by ear a little bit, woke up those morning feeling like shit, we'll see if an ibuprofen and nap take care of it. I'll let you know in a couple hours? "
2016-04-29,10:53:19,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,"I think if you come within 50 ft of my place, you'll still have to contend with it"
2016-04-29,10:55:24,in,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,"Okie sure. Hope u feel better! But no worries we could go tomorrow instead, or another time if u aren't feeling up to it"
2016-04-29,14:00:58,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,How was MIT girl? 
2016-04-29,14:33:13,out,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,"I think I'm going to bail for tonight :( Still not feeling great, and would hate to get you sick. Sorry for flaking!! "
2016-04-29,14:36:09,in,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,Don't worry about it! rest up and thanks for sparing me ;)
2016-04-29,14:44:05,out,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,Have to healthy for the game Sunday! 
2016-04-29,14:44:37,in,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,Yes sir we've gotta make this a winning streak
2016-04-29,14:59:45,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Well played cardshark, well played "
2016-04-29,15:47:35,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I actually have no idea lol
2016-04-29,15:47:43,out,+12078524607,Dacie Manion,Hell yeah! 
2016-04-29,16:01:33,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"I'm kind of at fault. I cleared out so much space from my phone and thought, hey look I have all this room to add music to. And filed it back up "
2016-04-29,16:02:22,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Just get Spotify man. Never download music again. 
2016-04-29,16:02:55,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I don't download anymore ;) I have a genius system 
2016-04-29,16:04:25,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"I hate the concept of streaming music. Not only does it waste data but the system is totally dependent on the supplier keeping the product available. I'd rather just own and rely upon myself. You can keep files on a flashdrive for years, while Spotify can go out of business any day now"
2016-04-29,16:05:38,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"T-Mobile doesn't charge data for Spotify (or netflix). Also, I'm more likely to lose flash drives or have my hard drive fail than Spotify is to go out of business"
2016-04-29,16:08:12,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Valid point. But given that Spotify is present, worst case scenario it's not a 1 or the other type of situation but rather a 1 then the other. I'll go to Spotify if all other sources fail. But right meow any playable song on the Internet is potentially in my music library  "
2016-04-29,16:08:36,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Without downloading or risking viral infection

2016-04-29,16:46:14,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,How do you have every song? 
2016-04-29,16:48:34,out,+13135804730,Dave Prylo,"Ah man, sorry to hear that... "
2016-04-29,16:48:46,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I bought screen recording software for my laptop. So I can film streamed videos like Indians baseball and whatnot. One of the added perks of it is that I can rip the audio from the video and just save the audio. So as long as I have access to YouTube I can record any music I want and upload it directly to iTunes. Game set match  
2016-04-29,16:53:53,in,+13135804730,Dave Prylo,"Yeah, I need another hiatus from the nightlife lol. I'll have a get together in Ferndale once I move though."
2016-04-29,17:44:22,out,+13135804730,Dave Prylo,Haha fair enough. Looking forward to it.
2016-04-29,17:46:13,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Yeah, but don't you lose quality? Also, that's a lot of manual work that you have to do at your computer. (say, for a whole album). Plus, my favorite parts of spotify are the suggested listening, browse categories, and shared playlists. And I don't have to do any work to have them."
2016-04-29,17:47:17,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Don't lose an ounce of quality luckily. Not too much really. Just hit record and listen to music. 
2016-04-29,17:48:03,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,What if you don't hit start/stop at the right time?
2016-04-29,17:49:00,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Lol well start is easy enough to remember. Stop can be tricky 
2016-04-29,17:53:27,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Hm, doesn't seem worth the effort"
2016-04-29,17:53:33,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,You should automate it
2016-04-29,17:53:57,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,You know about http://www.youtube-mp3.org/ ?
2016-04-29,17:54:07,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Ya

2016-04-29,18:01:21,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Or I can just hit f12 to stop the recording...
2016-04-29,18:01:55,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,To each his own haha
2016-04-29,18:03:45,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,If I was trying to rip every song on the Internet lol then that would be something for me
2016-04-29,18:03:48,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Although 
2016-04-29,18:05:32,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Adds are tricky. When an add pops up the recording doesn't know the difference and records it anyway. Then I have junk in the middle I have to edit out. Much easier would it be to write a script that can detect abrupt navigations from the page, when an add loads in and buffers, and immediately pause the recording until normal play is resumed. If that's even possible"

2016-04-29,18:27:49,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I'm fine with morally complicated. My entire iTunes library and video folders are morally complicated.

2016-04-29,18:28:31,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,lol fair enough. Then you're pretty much fine with downloading anything from a curated/reviewed marketplace.
2016-04-29,18:29:37,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Anything is better than the piratebay. I feel like my antivirus is cringing every time I log on. Although I did do the altruistic thing and ditched utorrent. It's morally reprehensible

2016-04-29,18:32:06,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Haha good for you
2016-04-29,18:32:27,out,+15083245310,Joe Hill,"Do you mean that sarcastically, or in the sense that she's not too interesting?"
2016-04-29,18:32:54,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,I got deluge instead. They aren't as intuitive in their layout but they don't sell your information to third parties so take it or leave it
2016-04-29,18:34:38,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Do you use it for movies?
2016-04-29,18:36:10,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,And music. Up until yesterday when I started this whole YouTube movement. The only thing I had to change was turning off auto seeding. Gotta remain anonymous 
2016-04-29,18:36:13,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"Also, philosophical question from earlier:

Do you ""own"" something digital (eg music) if:

1. You have the physical device it's stored on? What if it requires a license to access it, and that can expire/be revoked remotely?
2. You have something stored on google drive and can access it whenever you want?
3. You can stream something (say, from Spotify servers) any time you want?"
2016-04-29,18:38:41,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,"To me, something is owned if you can access it whenever you desire it. Like a book or a car. Or can have it whenever you express desire for it, if a car is getting fixed or a book lent to a friend. I don't think something can be classified as yours if it requires the good will of another to keep it going. Streaming from Spotify is a lot like renting a house. You have the benefits from it but it's not yours  "
2016-04-29,18:50:11,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,What about cars that have the onstar disable feature for when it's stolen. Can you own a car with that feature? 
2016-04-29,18:55:02,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Well my laptop can fit in a big enough microwave and fry the whole thing and I own that
2016-04-29,18:55:13,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,But let me think about your question more 
2016-04-29,19:11:47,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,To me that's similar to houses and hotels that have automatic fire alarms that signal the fire department to come. 
2016-04-29,19:14:26,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,That's similar to fire alarms on buildings that signal the fire department 
2016-04-29,19:23:37,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Dude adblock was easy as shit lol
2016-04-29,19:35:08,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Not necessarily. Other people can disable and lock your possession. I'd say a car alarm is the same as a fire alarm lol
2016-04-29,19:35:23,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,Yeah welcome to 2016 haha
2016-04-29,19:36:27,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,This just increased my audio capabilities 10fold. Estimating of course. So many longer mixes that I wanted had ads in the middle. 
2016-04-29,20:21:56,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,In the middle? Never saw that
2016-04-29,20:22:03,out,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,What do you use for sound editing? 
2016-04-29,20:26:43,in,+14404886932,Eric Schupp,For hour long videos it's common. And so far I haven't used anything. If you play the video thru once and then replay it most cases the ads don't come up again. But who has the time for that

2016-04-30,21:02:39,out,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,Just turned on the game. Looks like it's already over. 
2016-04-30,21:06:22,in,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,Haha. Van Gundy was completely wrong at least for this game.
2016-04-30,21:16:47,out,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,Unbelievable 
2016-04-30,21:23:01,out,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,They can sit their starters the whole second half

2016-05-28,18:44:47,out,+19414055914,Austin Childs,"Thank you sir. If you see any of the Canadians soon, please run it in--doing so over Facebook wasn't satisfying enough"
2016-05-28,18:47:34,in,+19414055914,Austin Childs,"Haha will do. I get off of work around 4. Could leave earlier if I need to, just have to tell my manager in advance"
2016-05-28,18:49:35,in,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Yeah I've been there! Actually she spent the whole day with him and needs to get away for a bit so we're gonna meet you at 8:30 and the engineer will just meet us there üòú

2016-05-28,19:24:23,in,+19414055914,Austin Childs,Sounds good to me. New gym might actually be more empty...

2016-05-28,20:11:58,out,+12482502003,Aries Tao,Sounds good

2016-05-28,20:31:38,out,+19414055914,Austin Childs,"Oh nice. I definitely want to see the new place, bringing my whole family (12 people) might be a bit much "
2016-05-28,20:37:23,in,+19414055914,Austin Childs,Lol Up to you. We can always get you up here another day if you prefer. I'm bringing my whole family though (10 people).

2016-05-29,03:37:09,in,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,Lol that was a gripping voicemail which I can only assume was your live commentary on the basketball game.
2016-05-29,11:25:44,out,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,"Oh whoops. If I'd know it was calling, I definitely would have offered commentary. What a game by Thompson, my god"

2016-05-29,13:20:13,out,+15862605459,Eric Beyer,I want it. We can take them
2016-05-29,14:46:24,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,Have I been responding to your messages? I feel like some texts are getting dropped... 
2016-05-29,14:47:09,in,+17347715710,Carly Adams,No that's my bad. I forgot to reply yesterday. I'm the worst with texting sometimes.
2016-05-29,14:54:26,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"Haha seems like I get a response in 1 minute or not at all? But no worries, I realized recently that my phone has been dropping texts, and it's made me overly paranoid."
2016-05-29,14:54:59,in,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"Yea, if I'm busy I'll make a mental note to reply later and then it just goes out the window."
2016-05-29,15:07:24,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"I'm guilty of the same, I can't believe that they haven't made a ""Mark as unread"" for texts yet."
2016-05-29,15:07:56,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,Still up for grabbing a drink this week?
2016-05-29,15:08:01,in,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"No kidding. Or a ""Remind me in an hour"" at least!"
2016-05-29,15:09:02,in,+17347715710,Carly Adams,Yea. I'll be around. What nights are good for you?
2016-05-29,15:17:44,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"This sounds like a million-dollar idea. Don't worry, I'll give you a small cut ;)"
2016-05-29,15:17:51,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,Tuesday or Wednesday should be good for me 
2016-05-29,15:19:00,in,+17347715710,Carly Adams,I might be able to do Tuesday.
2016-05-29,15:38:44,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"Great, what city are you in? I'm pretty close to some good bars in royal oak"

2016-05-29,16:06:57,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"Oh cool, I'd be down to check out midtown. Do you have a go-to place around there?"
2016-05-29,16:12:22,in,+17347715710,Carly Adams,I can usually be found at The Bronx. It's across the street from my place so I head their most nights to grab a drink and unwind.
2016-05-29,16:31:19,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"Haven't heard of it, but always up for trying a new place :) 9:00 work for you? "
2016-05-29,16:32:03,in,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"It's a total wannabe dive bar, just so you know. 9 on Tuesday? Should work but I'll let you know if that changes."
2016-05-29,16:38:07,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"Sounds good. Not sure what a wannabe dive bar looks like, but I guess I'll find out. "
2016-05-29,16:38:58,in,+17347715710,Carly Adams,"Haha, it's... An interesting place. Very chill vibe. Not everyone's cup of tea though."
2016-05-29,17:39:15,out,+17347715710,Carly Adams,If they sell beer I'll probably be satisfied haha
