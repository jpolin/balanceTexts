# Balance Texts

**Author:** Joe Polin 

**Date:** May 2016

**Description:** Much like balancing one's checkbook, it can be useful to cross-reference my records of text messages with my carrier's records. In this case, I want to compare a log of text messages exported from my phone (using [SMS to Text](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smeiti.smstotext&hl=en)) with the logs downloaded from my carrier's portal (in this case, T-Mobile). The goal is to detect dropped text messages (those recorded by T-Mobile but that never reached my phone).
